| CP001       | Viewing the Crime Map                            | As a user, I want to view a dynamic map showing reported criminal activities so that I can stay aware of safety concerns in my area.                     | The system displays an interactive map with approved crime report pins. Users can zoom and click on pins for additional details such as type, description, and media.      |
| CP002       | Adding a Crime Report (Pin)                      | As a user, I want to add a crime report by pinning a location, choosing a crime type, writing a description, and attaching photos or documents.          | The system allows users to click on the map to pin a location. A form is provided to select the crime type, enter a description, and attach supporting files.             |
| CP003       | User Registration for Report Submission          | As an unregistered user, I want to fill out a crime report form anonymously but be required to register before actually submitting the report.          | Users can initially fill out a report without registration. However, upon submission, the system requires them to register or log in to verify their identity.            |
| CP004       | Admin Panel: Review and Moderate Crime Reports   | As an admin, I want to review submitted crime reports and approve or deny them before they are displayed on the public map.                               | The admin panel (built with Backpack) lists pending crime reports with options to approve or deny each report. Only approved reports are published on the map and API.    |
| CP005       | Admin Panel: User Management                     | As an admin, I want to manage user accounts related to crime reporting, including the ability to create, enable/disable accounts, and update API keys. | The admin panel provides features for creating and managing user accounts. Administrators can adjust user statuses and update API keys used for accessing the developer API. |
| CP006       | API Access for Crime Data                        | As a registered developer with an active subscription, I want to retrieve approved crime report data via a RESTful API.                                  | The system provides a secure API endpoint that returns published crime report data (in JSON format) for developers. Access is restricted to verified users with active subscriptions. |
